The CrmQueryExtensions is a small library for making Microsoft Dynamics Query Expressions easier with less code. As the name states the library mainly contains C# extensions methods for the QueryExpression object.

## Installation

The library is available on [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/WareTec.CrmQueryExtensions)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WareTec.CrmQueryExtensions/). Just add the package in your solution. 
If the library will be used in a plugin/workflow dll please consider using ILMerge to merge the WareTec.CrmQueryExtensions.dll with your plugin dll. Otherwise your plugins will throw exceptions when trying to execute the extension methods.
